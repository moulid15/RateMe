I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
